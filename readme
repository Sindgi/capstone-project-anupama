Twitter Scraping
Built this app for Twitter Scraping by creating a web app using Streamlit. It scrapes the twitter data for the given hashtag/ keyword for the given period using snscrape library. The tweets are uploaded in MongoDB and can be dowloaded as CSV or a JSON file.Capstone Porject Title: Twitter Scrapping using SNSCRAPE

Description:
This repository contains a Python script for scraping Twitter data using the snscrape library. The script scrapes tweets based on a specified hashtag, username, or search term and saves the data to a CSV file.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
SNsccrape library(can be installed using pip install snscrape)

Installation:
Install the pip3 install git+https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape.git - developer version

Output:
The script outputs a CSV file with the following columns:

date: The date and time the tweet was posted
content: The text of the tweet
username: The username of the user who posted the tweet
url: The URL of the tweet
replyCount: The number of replies to the tweet
retweetCount: The number of retweets of the tweet
likeCount: The number of likes on the tweet

Limitations:

Twitter's API limits the number of tweets that can be scraped to a maximum of 100 per request.
Snscrape may not always return all tweets for a given query, especially for popular hashtags or search terms.
Scraping tweets may violate Twitter's terms of service. Use this script at your own risk.
